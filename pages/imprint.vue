          <h2>Liability for content</h2>
          <p>We endeavor to take the greatest possible care when creating the content on our website. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of this content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on our website in accordance with Section 7 (1) TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general law. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obliged to actively monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to search for signs that could indicate illegal activity. Legal obligations to remove or block the use of information are not affected by this. However, liability in this context is only possible from the time we become aware of a specific infringement. Should we become aware of such infringements, we will remove the content in question as quickly as possible.</p>

          <h2>Liability for links</h2>
          <p>

For this reason, we cannot accept any liability for this external content. The respective operator or provider of the linked pages is always responsible for their content. At the time of linking, the external sites were checked for possible legal violations; no illegal content was found. However, we cannot reasonably be expected to constantly monitor the content of the linked pages without clear indications of an infringement. Should we become aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
